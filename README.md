- Ensuite rooms page

- Router
- Populating the backend with dummy rooms and facilities

#### Goal 2: Ensure that a user can lock or hold a room, and navigate to the page for entering their details. This will involve the following:
- Availability check for rooms under a specific category

- Lock logic with timer.
- Popup for holding and locking room

#### Goal 3: Ensure that a user can complete payment, make a reservation, and receive the confirmation email. This will involve the following:

- Confirmation email

#### Goal 4: Admin can update the available rooms and see a summary of bookings. This will involve the following:
